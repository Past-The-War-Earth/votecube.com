# votecube-ui

The resolve to create Votecube arrived immediately after a very brief early morning dream of a rotating, shimmering with colors cube and a command to give it to the children.

Since a cube has 6 sides, two on each dimension the idea of a decision making interface was a natural fit. The total surface area of the 2-D projection of the cube was taken as 100 basis points. And rotating the cube can generate any combination of relative weights of 3 most important to a decision factors (with either For or Against side for each factor being visible).

After building a prototype and brainstorming it's usability with a friend a simpler input interface was built with 3 vertically arranged, flippable cards that can be dragged up or down to change the importance of the factors represented by the them.  Additionally a reporting bar chart interface allowing for bars to the left or right of the y axis was developed.

Subsequently, upon involving another friend (while having yet another friend on the phone) a decision was made to move away from a fun and easy poll collection platform to a  social support network that would allow people to vote on the ideas suggested to fix a posted issue.

Almost immediated after NLNM simulation proposal it was clear that the Votecube widget is needed there.  It will allow to report the situation for a unit based on 3 preset factors (which became apparent today):

Yellow - the shared NLNM goal
Orange - the tactical objective
Purple - the physical state of the troops

Favorite colors of wifes of the initial group of brainstormers determined the above palette during prototyping.

The card  interface it can be operated with in-armor finger presses and AR gestures.  The results can be aggregated and reported up the chain of command to an updating bar chart (in the helmet overhead display). Thus the Votecube project found it's first clear and necessary use in NLNM simulations.
